<strong>Small Volume Parenterals (SVP) Market Snapshot 2025-2033 provides a concise overview of market trends, forecasts, and growth opportunities over the forecast period:</strong>

Small volume parenteral (SVP) solutions are usually 100 ml or less and are packaged in different ways depending on the intended use. If the SVP is a liquid that is used primarily to deliver medications, it is packaged in a small plastic bag called a minibag of 50 - 100 ml (minibags look like small plastic LVP bags). SVPs can also be packaged as ampules, vials, and prefilled syringes. Liquid drugs are supplied in prefilled syringes, heat-sealed ampules, or in vials sealed with a rubber closure. Powdered drugs are supplied in vials and must be constituted (dissolved in a suitable liquid) before being added to any solution. SVPs packaged as ampules, vials, or prefilled syringes are typically added to a minibag or a LVP but they may also serve as the final container. The term admixture is used to denote a solution where such an additive has been added to a minibag or LVP.
